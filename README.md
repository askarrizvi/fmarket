  ## Description
  Our final project is a React and React-Redux app that provides a digital marketplace for farmers to sell their produce. The project uses many technologies including
  React, MongooseDB, jsonwebtoken, Bootstrap, GraphQL, Stripe, Redux, Apollo Server and Express. This application allows a user to create an account and purchase items
  from sellers. The checkout process is done through Stripe and each seller has their own unique cart that's separate from other sellers. A user can also open their
  own "stall" to sell their products to other users.
